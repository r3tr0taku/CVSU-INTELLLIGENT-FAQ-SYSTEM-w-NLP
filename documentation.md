## Introduction
The CvSU Intelligent FAQ System is a web-based application that provides automated responses to student inquiries based on the CvSU Student Handbook. The system utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and advanced search algorithms to understand and respond to user questions accurately.

## Problem Statement
Students often need quick access to information from the CvSU Student Handbook but may find it time-consuming to manually search through the document. Traditional search methods may not understand the context or variations in how questions are asked, leading to inefficient information retrieval.

## Objectives
1. To develop an intelligent FAQ system that can understand and respond to student inquiries accurately
2. To implement natural language processing for better question understanding
3. To provide quick and relevant responses from the Student Handbook
4. To handle variations in question phrasing through synonym matching
5. To offer a user-friendly interface for students
6. To reduce the workload on administrative staff by automating common inquiries

## Expected Output
- A web-based FAQ system with natural language understanding
- Accurate and relevant responses to student queries
- Intelligent handling of similar questions through synonym matching
- Suggestion system for related topics when exact matches aren't found
- User-friendly interface with instant responses

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
The system uses a Flask-based backend with the following components:
- Flask web server
- spaCy NLP engine
- JSON-based FAQ database
- Rule-based keyword matching system
- Semantic similarity search

### Frontend Architecture
- HTML5 interface
- JavaScript for dynamic interactions
- CSS for styling and responsiveness

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies
1. **Python 3.x**
   - Main programming language for backend development
   - Handles core logic and NLP processing

2. **Flask Framework**
   - Web application framework
   - Handles routing and API endpoints
   - Manages static file serving

3. **spaCy**
   - Natural Language Processing library
   - Uses 'en_core_web_md' model for:
     - Text processing
     - Semantic similarity analysis
     - Token processing

4. **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**
   - Frontend interface development
   - Dynamic content updates
   - User interaction handling

### Libraries and Dependencies
- Flask: Web framework
- spaCy: NLP processing
- NumPy: Numerical computations
- JSON: Data storage and manipulation

## Features

### 1. Intelligent Search System
The system implements a dual-search approach:

#### Rule-Based Keyword Search
- Processes user queries for keywords
- Maintains an extensive synonym dictionary
- Maps related terms to common concepts
- Uses keyword indexing for faster searches

#### Semantic Search
- Utilizes spaCy's similarity analysis
- Considers both questions and answers
- Provides weighted matching scores
- Handles natural language variations

### 2. Synonym Matching
Comprehensive synonym dictionary covering:
- General Information
- Admission & Enrollment
- Academic Policies
- Fees & Scholarships
- Conduct & Discipline
- Services & Facilities
- Activities
- Graduation & Completion
- Miscellaneous categories

### 3. Smart Response System
- Confidence scoring for responses
- Related topic suggestions
- Fallback responses for unmatched queries
- Context preservation in responses

### 4. User Interface
- Clean and intuitive design
- Real-time response display
- Confidence level indication
- Related topic suggestions

## Implementation Details

### Search Algorithm
The system uses a two-tier search approach:

1. **First Tier: Rule-Based Search**
```python
def rule_based_search(query):
    - Processes query for keywords
    - Expands search with synonyms
    - Uses indexed keyword matching
    - Returns results above 0.3 confidence threshold
```

2. **Second Tier: NLP Search**
```python
def nlp_search(query):
    - Uses spaCy similarity analysis
    - Considers both questions and answers
    - Weights answer similarity at 0.5
    - Returns results above 0.6 confidence threshold
```

### Data Processing
1. **Query Processing**
   - Tokenization
   - Stop word removal
   - Lemmatization
   - Synonym expansion

2. **Response Generation**
   - Confidence scoring
   - Source tracking
   - Related topic suggestion
   - Formatted response creation

## File Structure

### Core Files
1. **app.py**
   - Main application file
   - Contains core logic and routing
   - Implements search algorithms
   - Manages API endpoints

2. **static/faqs.json**
   - FAQ database
   - Structured question-answer pairs
   - Source for search operations

3. **templates/index.html**
   - Main user interface
   - Frontend implementation
   - User interaction handling

4. **static/css/**
   - Style definitions
   - UI components
   - Responsive design

5. **static/js/**
   - Frontend logic
   - AJAX request handling
   - Dynamic content updates
